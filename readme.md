# Scrabble app

## Vision
The vision of scrabble is to create the well-known board game in app format. Players will need to register first and after login they will be able to play against each other. Everybody will be able to excess their previous game stats too.

## Environment and technology
* React
* Bootstrap 5
* Node.js
* Plans for backend: MongoDB, Express, Swagger
* Plans for testing: Jest
* Plans for making running easier: Docker
* Yarn

## Running the app
* For now you can only run frontend. Create a `.env.local` file with your settings, use `.env.example` as an example. 
* Future plans: Same structure for backend, using Docker, using seeder for creating data to work with at beginning.
