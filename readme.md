# Scrabble app

## Vision
The vision of scrabble is to create the well-known board game in app format. Players will need to register first and after login they will be able to play against each other. Everybody will be able to excess their previous game stats too.

## Environment and technology
* React
* Bootstrap 5
* Node.js
* Express
* Typescript
* MongoDB
* Swagger
* Jest
* Plan for easier deployment: Docker
* Yarn

## Running the app
* Frontend side: create a `.env.local` file with your settings, use `.env.example` as an example. In the app folder use `yarn install` command then use `yarn start`
* Backend side: create a `.env` file with your settings, use `.env.example` as an example. In the api folder use `yarn install` command then use `yarn start`
* Future plans: I'm going to use Docker, and probably will make a seeder for creating data to work with at beginning.
